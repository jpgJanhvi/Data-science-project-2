Data Science Project: Global Meat Consumption Analysis
Overview
This data science project aims to analyze global meat consumption trends using machine learning regression models. The project involves preprocessing the dataset, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. After preprocessing, various regression models are trained and evaluated to predict meat consumption based on different features.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is "global_meat.csv". It contains information about meat consumption across different countries over multiple years.
